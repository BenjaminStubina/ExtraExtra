TORONTO — ExtraExtra is stepping up for Canadians at a time when access to reliable information is more important than ever.

The decision is a direct response to the Online News Act, a Federal bill requiring Big Tech to [share ad revenue][can] with news publishers. “This ban hurts all Canadians by placing barriers on high-quality journalism,” says ExtraExtra co-creator [Benny Goldman][linkedGold].
