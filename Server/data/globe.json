But over the past 25 years, he’s also become one of the most critically maligned.⁠\n⁠\nWith his collection of cartoon figures rendered with bulging foreheads and crossed out eyes, Donnelly has defied art world conventions, attracting the attention of stars and fashion brands along the way.⁠\n⁠\nThis week, the Art Gallery of Ontario launched KAWS: FAMILY, an exhibition of his work. The exhibition is an undeniable validation for Donnelly after years of establishment rejection, but it’s also a new way to be exposed to audiences beyond the hypebeasts that built his following on social media. For the AGO, it’s a chance to learn more about its rapidly shifting audience.

If someone did die while in a hospital, they were buried there.⁠\n⁠\nNow, the Nanilavut project is dedicated to finding the graves of lost Inuit TB patients. As of this summer, they identified 27 graves of Inuit whose families knew they had died in the south, but who didn’t know where they were buried.

Born in Vancouver on Oct. 11, 1929, for years the federal government confined Mr. Moriyama’s family along with 22,000 other Japanese-Canadians, exiling them from their homes on the B.C. coast to old mining towns.⁠\n⁠\nMr. Moriyama began his practice in 1958 with a set of ideals common among young architects: a commitment to public buildings and to exploring formal and technical innovation.
