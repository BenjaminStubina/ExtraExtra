Born in Vancouver on Oct. 11, 1929, for years the federal government confined Mr. Moriyama’s family along with 22,000 other Japanese-Canadians, exiling them from their homes on the B.C. coast to old mining towns.⁠\n⁠\nMr. Moriyama began his practice in 1958 with a set of ideals common among young architects: a commitment to public buildings and to exploring formal and technical innovation. His work was always shaped by specific narratives and concepts, elaborated with great care.

When she can, she polishes her riding form on a home-made bucking contraption fashioned out of a barrel by her father.⁠\n⁠\nHer goal is to qualify for the Junior World Finals in Las Vegas in December, which is within reach, given that she’s placed the top bull-riding division on the Crooked Horn Canadian Junior Rodeo Association for much of the season.⁠\n⁠\nShe would also love to compete in the Canadian high school rodeo this August in Brandon, Man., but organizers adhere to American high-school guidelines stipulating that rough-stock events – bull riding, saddle bronc, bareback – are open to “boys only.”⁠\n⁠\nSwipe to see her in action, and visit the link in our bio for more photos and the full story.⁠\n⁠\nStory and photos by Leah Hennel (@leahhennelphoto)⁠\n⁠\n#BullRiding⁠\n#Rodeo⁠\n#BullRider","created_time":1691771679,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/1976d4ba6b98a1-LIB37117393.jpg?width=960&t=1691771679&sig=f9cc92843c0817bd898a7dc576a2b49332837b3d3415084aae4325fc9efd0897","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/1976d4ba6b98a1-LIB37117393.jpg","instagram_profile_id":7707772,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/1976d4ba6b98a1-LIB37117393.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1691771679&sig=bd7cbd6535e5f59cdc7b240b1cd0ee9cd7ec176b5a40696bbf1907045ee0875d","link_url":"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-teaghan-bertamini-bull-riding-alberta/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globeandmail&utm_content=later-37117393&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17884121684909076","media_type":"carousel","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/1976d4ba6b98a1-LIB37117393.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1691771679&sig=17518bb09a845d0c67f5ff72e81d88c83e643ab2afc57f8d21e4f3f14c08a7f3","network_type":"instagram","post_id":305223608,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1691771717,"social_profile_id":7707772,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37069988,"caption":"Guitarist, songwriter and singer Robbie Robertson, who led the Canadian-American group The Band, has died at the age of 80, his manager said on Wednesday.⁠\n⁠\nThe Toronto-born musician spent part of his childhood in Six Nations Indian Reserve in southwestern Ontario, which had an enormous influence on him and his music.⁠\n⁠\nThe Band was one of the biggest rock groups of the 1960s and '70s, and their 1976 farewell concert in San Francisco was the basis of Martin Scorsese’s 1978 movie “The Last Waltz.”⁠\n⁠\nRobertson died in Los Angeles surrounded by his family after a long illness, according to his manager's statement.
