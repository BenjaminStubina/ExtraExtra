Moments after 16-year-old Armita Geravand is seen on video entering a subway car, she was carried out by passengers, unconscious.⁠\n⁠\nKurdish human rights organization Hengaw claims Geravand suffered a “severe physical assault” on Oct. 1 at the hands of Iranian morality police for not wearing a head covering, mandatory only for women in the country. ⁠\n⁠\nMeanwhile, state-run media reports that she suffered a drop in blood pressure and fainted, which caused her to hit her head.⁠\n⁠\nOn Thursday, Hengaw and Reuters reported that Geravand’s mother was arrested near the hospital where her daughter is being treated.⁠\n⁠\nGeravand’s hospitalization has drawn parallels to the case of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in hospital last year after being detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing a hijab. Amini’s death kickstarted months of protests in Iran — as well as demonstrations around the globe — against the morality police and head-covering laws.⁠\n⁠\nSurveillance camera footage of Geravand inside the Tehran metro was released by Iranian state-run news agency IRNA and obtained by Reuters. The video, though low quality, shows Geravand accompanied by two female friends walking toward the train from the metro platform.⁠\n⁠\nUpon entering the train, one of the girls is seen immediately backing off and reaching for the ground, before another girl is dragged unconscious from the cabin by passengers.⁠\n⁠\nFootage from inside the train, which could shed light on what made the 16-year-old collapse, has not been released by the government or state-run media.⁠\n⁠\nA separate video of Geravand before she reached the train platform shows her looking at items in a convenience store inside the station. This video more clearly shows the part of her short black hair, revealing she wasn’t wearing a head covering that day.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n","created_time":1696628659,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/805d7e889f16cb-LIB38352475.jpg?width=960&t=1696628659&sig=f9404e2437978326a97e6d4c2b7bd5b665ed7bd7d7cedf75b0567c9db59c8670","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/805d7e889f16cb-LIB38352475.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/805d7e889f16cb-LIB38352475.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696628659&sig=ba142e3342300230634f7770e200a36306d0a9ce83dc2d27e0024319a287f597","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10007430/armita-geravand-coma-iran-morality-police-hijab/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38352475&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18200322568263108","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/805d7e889f16cb-LIB38352475.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696628659&sig=54de2efa0680fefc93f71c007519ea89543812b9bf353d6adf7d0d7b15344474","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311438431,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696628712,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38347485,"caption":"With the Writers Guild of America strike now over, The Drew Barrymore Show is once again gearing up to return — but Barrymore’s three head writers aren’t on board.⁠\n⁠\nThough the daytime talker announced on Wednesday that it would make its Season 4 return on Oct. 16, the Writers Guild members who formerly worked on the show have declined offers to return.⁠\n⁠\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the outlet to first break the news, co-head writers Cristina Kinon, Chelsea White and Liz Koe were made offers to return to the show after the WGA strike was lifted on Sept. 27.⁠\n⁠\nAll three women have been with The Drew Barrymore Show since its first season.⁠\n⁠\nIt has not been confirmed why the co-head writers declined to return to The Drew Barrymore Show, but it’s widely thought to be because of Barrymore’s rush to return to production during the strike.⁠\n⁠\nThe production is now interviewing new candidates and will remain in compliance with WGA standards.⁠\n⁠\nBarrymore, 48, made a stir last month when she announced her talk show would return without its WGA writers, who were still on strike.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Instagram @cbkinon","created_time":1696616193,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/d38c7b7948f467-LIB38347485.jpg?width=960&t=1696616193&sig=e97e243da6b5fb42198f379fff70aa4fee958d96794399b15067fc191509dae9","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/d38c7b7948f467-LIB38347485.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/d38c7b7948f467-LIB38347485.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696616193&sig=1fce856349147474e099e11d295ad8764cb401d3cd2fd0e04788e453fe468c74","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10006618/drew-barrymore-show-writers-wont-return-strike/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38347485&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17873409161978201","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/d38c7b7948f467-LIB38347485.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696616193&sig=e93532b9add65f36a77bab113222b681c1f9dd84265a22f342ab8ec4cecc6489","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311413574,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696616233,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38322966,"caption":"The city of light is going to war against a “scourge” of bed bugs that have been spotted and filmed in various public places around Paris.⁠\n⁠\nResidents have been taking to social media in recent days to share footage of the blood-sucking pests crawling over seats in the Paris metro and high-speed trains. There are also reports of bed bugs being spotted in cinemas and even at Charles de Gaulle airport.⁠\n⁠\nThe furor over the bed bugs infestation started during Paris Fashion Week and now threatens to put a damper on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics — only 10 months away — if officials aren’t able to get the pests under control.⁠\n⁠\n“The state urgently needs to put an action plan in place against this scourge as France is preparing to welcome the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2024,” the capital’s deputy mayor, Emmanuel Gregoire, said in a letter to Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne this week.⁠\n⁠\n“Bedbugs are a public health issue and should be declared as such,” he wrote.⁠\n⁠\nGregoire added in a social media post that “no one is safe” from the bed bug infestation. He told French broadcaster LCI that the problem is “widespread” and residents are in danger of bringing bed bugs home if they encounter them in public.⁠\n⁠\nAbout one in 10 French households are believed to have had a bed bug infestation over the past few years, AFP reports. Extermination and fumigation often costs several hundreds of dollars.⁠\n⁠\nDeputy Mayor Grégoire says Paris is helping lower-income households to cover the cost of extermination, but he is calling on home insurance companies to “do their part” in supporting residents.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Getty","created_time":1696539071,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/fa7f3af557e89d-LIB38322966.jpg?width=960&t=1696539071&sig=38ed7b1c561f6efb7cc2df79d7ea00389d5ef68cc67c3c83e72c02b9a9c09c6b","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/fa7f3af557e89d-LIB38322966.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/fa7f3af557e89d-LIB38322966.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696539071&sig=1f069c75f57331d270ec68b4389d57b10a33d51a392f7044476fb769db20b857","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10001650/paris-bed-bugs-infestation/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38322966&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18280875136195097","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/fa7f3af557e89d-LIB38322966.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696539071&sig=45b095607897f8da8f7f238e0a686908e32e7362790a80392f78343f98baf6c4","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311297710,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696539198,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38296149,"caption":"Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., has been hit with a lawsuit from a woman claiming she suffered serious “gynecologic injuries” after riding a waterslide in the park’s Typhoon Lagoon area.⁠\n⁠\nEmma McGuinness, 33, and her husband on Wednesday sued the Disney amusement park for US$50,000 (nearly C$68,550) in damages, according to the Washington Post.⁠\n⁠\nIn the lawsuit filed in Orange County, Fla., McGuinness said the 214-foot (over 65 metres) waterslide, called Humunga Kowabunga, caused her an “injurious wedgie” that damaged her internal organs.⁠\n⁠\nThe incident occurred on Oct. 14, 2019, when McGuinness and her family visited the park to celebrate her 30th birthday. As part of the trip, McGuinness chose to ride Humunga Kowabunga — a popular thrill-seeking attraction that sees brave riders plunge five storeys in darkness through a massive body slide at a 60-degree angle.⁠\n⁠\nA long canal of water is meant to slow the landing of riders as they reach the bottom of Humunga Kowabunga; instead, McGuinness said, the flume of standing water “painfully forced” her one-piece bathing suit into her body.⁠\n⁠\nWalt Disney World has not commented publicly on the legal filing.⁠\n⁠\nThough McGuinness said she rode the slide in the proper position with her ankles crossed underneath her body, she became airborne toward the end of the ride. The impact of landing on the slide allegedly pushed the swimsuit fabric between her legs and “violently forced” a rush of water inside her body.⁠\n⁠\n“She experienced immediate and severe pain internally and, as she stood up, blood began rushing from between her legs,” the lawsuit reads.⁠\n⁠\nMcGuinness was brought to hospital. There, doctors discovered she suffered “severe and permanent bodily injury including severe vaginal lacerations.” The injuries included “a full thickness laceration” that caused McGuinness’s “bowel to protrude through her abdominal wall.”⁠\n⁠\nSome of McGuinness’ injuries were serious enough to require surgery.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images","created_time":1696456998,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=960&t=1696456998&sig=5b3c4adecaf59336d828ca6e64303c30eef69d8aa1df6ef839f0a647f7310690","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696456998&sig=d98ac54ae63d1210d4bb43913f6ff7cb46a348eeb729b8fdfbcc4fa1ae5d3502","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10001607/disney-world-lawsuit-waterslide-woman-injured/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38296149&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18061199851413464","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696456998&sig=d45f4a1ae470290fa4292979b761a06322214777ba7a4a325b9a802ac67c292d","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311164899,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696457113,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38266351,"caption":"Liberal MP Greg Fergus replaced Anthony Rota as Speaker of the House of Commons Tuesday, making history as the first Black Canadian to hold the role.⁠\n⁠\nFergus, who represents the National Capital Region Quebec riding of Hull—Aylmer, was one of seven candidates vying for the job after Rota resigned from it last week amid international controversy over his actions during a recent visit by Ukraine’s president.⁠\n⁠\n“Today, you are the first Black Canadian to become Speaker of this House,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after the election.⁠\n⁠\n“This should be inspiring for all Canadians.”⁠\n⁠\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called Fergus’s election an “incredible feat.”⁠\n⁠\nFergus’s election follows a day of pitches from the other MPs seeking the role: Liberal MP Sean Casey kicked off the speeches saying there needs to be a reset in the House when it comes to decorum, while Liberal MP Alexandra Mendes said more than anything, civility is needed.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press","created_time":1696368489,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=960&t=1696368489&sig=e515ca62f667dd4bf6e526034557aa3e6965320124be6cde584551433e444ce5","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696368489&sig=f36176d45a9b436ff6d3b1d31e6c9eaf375e747a6cba5248d75297be0bc23cd4","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10000914/canada-house-speaker-election/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38266351&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18023979991731500","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696368489&sig=3bccc4d6b358a5580fbe84b9f2b20186aff1e3f4cb23ae55d8afec652ac9465e","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311014078,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696368528,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38259084,"caption":"Actor Tom Hanks has warned his fans not to fall victim to an advertisement using a fake photo of him generated by artificial intelligence (AI).⁠\n⁠\nOn Saturday, the 67-year-old film star said the advertisement was using his likeness without his permission to hawk a dental plan.⁠\n⁠\nHanks shared a screenshot of the ad to Instagram with the caption, “Beware!!

Prior to this discovery, archaeologists knew there had been earlier settlements on the island, but only had concrete proof dating back to the Middle Ages. ⁠\n⁠\nThis discovery is believed to be the first Viking-era find on the island.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Kulturarv i Vestfold og Telemark fylkeskommune","created_time":1696280029,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8753caa75477ac-LIB38236269.jpg?width=960&t=1696280029&sig=1a667d2a68930d752411a20c1b9ffc9b7febff4553ba67e31f574f249536c201","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/8753caa75477ac-LIB38236269.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8753caa75477ac-LIB38236269.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696280029&sig=8dc12dea39deb850d4f348c051bc4c3ce27ba0a18b761145693c476f9041ba57","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9994813/family-searching-earrings-finds-viking-treasure-norway/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38236269&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17916826673802269","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8753caa75477ac-LIB38236269.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696280029&sig=53707d0da3b75b90d9c058ca1764c5362126d0e7114a9d9b4af1df1e7a10c7e9","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310855336,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696280056,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38230241,"caption":"Merriam-Webster announced that it has added 690 new words, phrases and acronyms to its dictionary.⁠\n⁠\nMany of the additions are humourous slang words and phrases that originated from internet and video-gaming culture.

Approximately 326,942 vehicles in Canada are affected, as well as 1.6 million cars in the U.S.⁠\n⁠\nTransport Canada says the issue with these Hyundai models stems from the anti-lock brake system, which can leak brake fluid and cause a short circuit.⁠\n⁠\nHyundai Canada told Global News that an electrical short can increase the risk of the engine catching on fire while driving or even when its parked and turned off.⁠\n⁠\nSo far, there have been “no crashes, injuries, or fatalities attributable to this condition,” Hyundai Canada said.⁠\n⁠\nHowever, in the U.S., Hyundai has reported 21 vehicle fires and 22 “thermal incidents, including visible smoke, burning and melting” related to the recalled cars.⁠\n⁠\nHyundai Canada says owners can continue driving the recalled cars, but “recommends parking the vehicles outside and away from structures until the recall remedy is completed.”⁠\n⁠\nAs for Kia, the vehicles that have been recalled include certain 2010-2017 models of the Sportage, Optima, Forte, Sorento, Soul, Rio, Cadenza, Rondo, Borrego and K900. Approximately 276,225 cars in Canada have been recalled, as well as 1.7 million vehicles in the U.S.⁠\n⁠\nThe issue with the cars also creates a “fire risk,” like with the Hyundai models, but the culprit this time is the brake hydraulic electronic control unit, which can short circuit even while the vehicle is parked and turned off, Transport Canada said.⁠\n⁠\nKia owners are also cautioned to park their vehicles outdoors and away from other cars or buildings until the necessary repairs can be completed.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Getty","created_time":1696075491,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=960&t=1696075491&sig=1e4ac3c37421b9666549985f01e02698153a71ddc4c903ebe6d19e1d06608c71","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696075491&sig=d0b474571380efb00cc5aa198495a28907d26b6113e892487e649e36d5cc4e84","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9991443/hyundai-kia-recall-canada-fire/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38197567&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18000022834976715","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696075491&sig=c3ab8987e39898514bfd0cdca484fd30eaab7c03f0461f8b3c700f32d6db35c2","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310636476,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696096994,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38165191,"caption":"A hungry black bear interrupted a family picnic in the north of Mexico on Monday, devouring a whole bunch of enchiladas and tacos.

He moved to London as a child and went on to apprentice as a toolmaker before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.⁠\n⁠\nBefore donning a long, white beard to play Dumbledore for the first time in 2004’s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gambon already had an esteemed stage, TV and film career.⁠\n⁠\nGambon was tapped to take over the role of the Hogwarts’ headmaster in 2004 following the death of Richard Harris in October 2002. Harris played Dumbledore in the first two films in the Harry Potter franchise.⁠\n⁠\nThroughout his lifetime, Gambon was nominated for two Emmy Awards and won four BAFTA Awards, two Olivier Awards and a SAG Award for outstanding cast performance in The King’s Speech. ⁠\n⁠\nHe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Global News","created_time":1695922498,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=960&t=1695922498&sig=bd0a419dc39731ef8186dbc787b3f55e7c524ebb21a012fe061b99be5dd3be3c","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695922498&sig=db547961b97bf02f0e7b6d74e36c354cbcbbc21a121d554ef9a2b784f60ac63c","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9991426/michael-gambon-dumbledore-harry-potter-dies-82/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38158233&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17981370149440305","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695922498&sig=63a420a02c27ca004b7ee0f58e38b075a8465fd4abdd98ac2fea9beffa6e087b","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310440889,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695922514,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38153194,"caption":"President Joe Biden’s dog, Commander, can’t seem to keep his mouth to himself.⁠\n⁠\nFor the 11th time, the adolescent German Shepherd has bit someone — this time a U.S. Secret Service agent.⁠\n⁠\nIn July, White House officials said the first family was working with new training and leash protocols to help the reactive animal.⁠\n⁠\nResponding to this most recent bite, Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for the first lady, Jill Biden, told The Guardian: “The White House can be a stressful environment for family pets, and the first family continues to work on ways to help Commander handle the often unpredictable nature of the White House grounds.”⁠\n⁠\nShe said the Bidens are “incredibly grateful to the Secret Service and executive residence staff for all they do to keep them, their family, and the country safe.”⁠\n⁠\nEarlier in Biden’s tenure, another of his dogs, Major, was involved in biting incidents at the White House and was moved out to live with family friends in Delaware.

He had just celebrated his 90th birthday less than a week ago on Sept. 19.⁠\n⁠\nMcCallum was the last original cast member on CBS’s NCIS, in which he played a bookish medical examiner for the Naval Criminal Investigation Service. The fan-favourite character of Ducky was introduced during the show’s launch in 2003 and appeared right through to the 20th season finale in May 2023.⁠\n⁠\nIn recent years, the actor had taken on a lighter shooting schedule for NCIS so he could spend time with his wife of 56 years, Katherine Carpenter, his children, grandchildren and cat, Nickie.⁠\n⁠\nScottish-born McCallum became a household name in the mid-’60s playing agent Illya Kuryakin in The Man from U.N.C.L.E, a TV series that rode the wave of spy thrillers that came out after the success of the James Bond films.⁠\n⁠\nMcCallum’s enigmatic, intellectual character on the show was particularly popular with teenage girls at the time — no doubt helped by the actor’s good looks and Beatlesque haircut.

Several of the girls appear momentarily confused as they pose for photos and wave at their parents, all the while the Black gymnast remains without a medal.⁠\n⁠\nOn Monday, Gymnastics Ireland released a statement of apology to the girl and her family. Though the family has remained unnamed publicly, the girl’s mother told several media outlets the behaviour of Gymnastics Ireland — and the untimeliness of its regret — is unacceptable.⁠\n⁠\nEighteen months after the original incident, and after the family filed a complaint with the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation in Switzerland, Gymnastic Ireland “unreservedly” apologized on Sunday. The apology was shared publicly the following day.⁠\n⁠\nThe body promised “nothing like this will happen again.” It said an independent expert will review the organization’s policies and procedures this year.⁠\n⁠\nThe young gymnast’s mother told The Guardian that despite arranging mediation between the family and the judge who handed out the medals, a representative from Gymnastics Ireland did not attend the meeting. The family said the decision not to attend the mediation wrongfully painted the incident as a personal dispute between them and the judge.⁠\n⁠\nGymnastics Ireland told The Guardian the organization “went to great lengths over the extended period to encourage participation in the mediation by both parties.” The body said it only recently “became aware that the family had expected an official representative from GI to be present at the mediation.”⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.","created_time":1695761388,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=960&t=1695761388&sig=303cc2c05ba502e4a832a22f6ec5c5bbd89d26c91e8c044f409759561ea8c947","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695761388&sig=a8ee3ad4ba67889033fc486b40b5af05bc44c52540915be897f52c8638f52aef","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9983110/gymnastics-ireland-apology-black-gymnast-denied-medal/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38107449&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17904346466779511","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695761388&sig=a5bf3c0cb7745aa6d8ea3393976db4c3e07ce151caf4732a55ea16503f767e54","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310190370,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695761416,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38081163,"caption":"House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota apologized again Monday for last week inviting and paying tribute to a Ukrainian Second World War veteran who fought for Nazi Germany.⁠\n⁠\nThe tribute happened on Friday when Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president who is also Jewish, was in Ottawa for his first official visit since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.⁠\n⁠\nRota, who said he regretted his decision and was “deeply sorry” for any hurt he caused, is facing calls from the NDP and the Bloc Québécois to resign as Speaker.⁠\n⁠\n“My intention was to show that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not a new one; that Ukrainians have unfortunately been subject to foreign aggression for far too long and that this must end,” he said.⁠\n⁠\n“I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision to recognize this individual.

I am deeply sorry that I have offended many with my gesture and remarks.”⁠\n⁠\nDuring Zelenskyy’s visit to the House of Commons, he joined MPs and the Ukrainian delegation during two separate standing ovations for 98-year-old Yaroslav Hunka.⁠\n⁠\nRota said he invited Hunka to the House of Commons, and that he was a constituent of his Ontario riding, Nipissing-Timiskaming. He described Hunka as a veteran who fought for “Ukrainian independence against the Russians.”⁠\n⁠\n“He is a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero, and we thank him for all his service,” Rota said.⁠\n⁠\nThe Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies said in a statement that Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, also known as the First Ukrainian Division, and demanded an apology.⁠\n⁠\nRota issued a written apology on Sunday, and delivered another at the start of House of Commons proceedings Monday — but that was not enough for the NDP, which is demanding his resignation as Speaker.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n","created_time":1695679083,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/302aad6d1413ad-LIB38081163.jpg?width=960&t=1695679083&sig=1fba9fc969a805f362822539d634980c8dd2dfcca8f4839af82c8d34b2a05998","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/302aad6d1413ad-LIB38081163.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/302aad6d1413ad-LIB38081163.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695679083&sig=ba8307e5a4e518347af5cb1f4989af524b972662de0d8246bd33dc33265da750","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9983103/anthony-rota-ukraine-nazi-unit-apology/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38081163&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17954282867534088","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/302aad6d1413ad-LIB38081163.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695679083&sig=d97ea551165a7207930be8c1ac5fc8d9d3607f326b2ea256dcee9b903c4bd761","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310055527,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695679245,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38049514,"caption":"Since filing her lawsuit against the Church of Scientology last month, Leah Remini has accused the organization of retaliating against her with a campaign of “continued, aggressive harassment.”⁠\n⁠\nRemini, 53, sued the church and its leader David Miscavige in August for harassment, stalking, defamation and a myriad of other alleged illegal activities. She accused Scientology of using “mob-style operations and attacks” to harass her since she defected from the faith in 2013.⁠\n⁠\nRemini has since amended her lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court and claimed the harassment against her has “escalated to a much greater degree than ever before,” according to Deadline, which shared the revised complaint.⁠\n⁠\nScientology has not yet responded publicly to Remini’s new allegations. The organization previously called the lawsuit “pure lunacy” and accused Remini of “spreading falsehoods and hate speech.”⁠\n⁠\n“Remini’s complaints are like an anti-Semite complaining about the Jewish Anti-Defamation League for exposing the anti-Semite’s bigotry and propaganda,” the Church wrote. “The Church is not intimidated by Remini’s latest act of blatant harassment and attempt to prevent truthful free speech. If Remini does not believe in free speech, then she should consider emigrating to Russia.”⁠\n⁠\n“Since the filing of my lawsuit, these attacks have escalated dramatically and have now more than ever focused not only on me, but my family members, my friends and professional colleagues,” Remini wrote in her amendment, according to NBC News. “To date, my requests have been dismissed as these abuses continue on a daily basis.”⁠\n⁠\nRemini claimed that since filing the lawsuit against Scientology, “potential fraud” has been flagged on several of her credit cards. The instance of fraud is allegedly “significantly higher” than any fraud previously witnessed by Remini’s financial manager. ⁠\n⁠\nA tutor hired by Remini — who said they’ve separately been targeted by Scientology promotions — was also hacked, resulting in an apparent US$15,000 (over C$21,100) loss to their business.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Michael Tran/Getty Images","created_time":1695560806,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=960&t=1695560806&sig=c5c01480085fac728270762506ebef006eb9d490f4f1b0841819081e375a3291","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695560806&sig=ba5f02155908f7c128757a8133683c4243210c3f3d6250cbfd821b213c457845","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9978691/leah-remini-scientology-harassment-lawsuit-mother-friends/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38049514&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17955837695530359","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695560806&sig=231467f7507915f801d04983a3bf1c5e25e6b36e65efd9b6f3ea9b1d1007dc95","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309893984,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695567911,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38041974,"caption":"The first-ever painting completed on television by Bob Ross — the beloved, perm-sporting artist who celebrated his “happy accidents” — is on sale for US$9.8 million (over C$13.2 million).⁠\n⁠\nRoss painted A Walk in the Woods in 1983 during the first episode of his TV show The Joy of Painting, which captured the hearts (and paintbrushes) of audiences around the globe. For 27 minutes, viewers watched Ross as he demonstrated how to paint a scenic, autumnal tree line.⁠\n⁠\nA Walk in the Woods was listed for sale by Ryan Nelson, who owns the art gallery Modern Artifact. The listing calls the artwork “the most historically significant Bob Ross original painting ever created.”⁠\n⁠\n“It is exceedingly rare to find any Bob Ross episode pieces, and this is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own the very first one,” the gallery wrote.⁠\n⁠\nThe painting includes a red “Ross” signature from the artist, and comes with a written statement from the original, and only, owner who was there at the time this piece was painted by Bob Ross.⁠\n⁠\nThe previous owner, who is not named by Modern Artifact, bought the painting in an auction to raise funds for a local PBS station. After purchasing the piece for an undisclosed amount, the woman hung A Walk in the Woods in her home for 39 years, The Associated Press reported.⁠\n⁠\nThough Ross normally painted three versions of his works — a reference image before filming the TV show, one during filming and another for his step-by-step books — the version for sale was proven to be the one painted by Ross on camera. ⁠\n⁠\nThe Washington Post reported it took art analysts at Bob Ross Inc., the company that owns the rights to his TV show, two days to determine Ross’ brush strokes and knife work was identical to the version of A Walk in the Woods now owned by Modern Artifact.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage 1: Acey Harper/Getty Images⁠\nImage 2: AP Photo/Mark Vancleave","created_time":1695473705,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=960&t=1695473705&sig=dea7312703ec61e7577de0ca640e2b39e074acd443a05d4e3db00960690eeeda","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695473705&sig=edd722a78aaa852e3746d16f049e25821ed2fcb055f1ed5d58d960186e737667","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9976319/bob-ross-painting-sale/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38041974&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18235705465236698","media_type":"carousel","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695473705&sig=a28946237730d8be9719f345478c27d4a88096d4dffdb75825bf16a8e9c6db38","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309855938,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695484873,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]}],"linkinbio_page_id":37292}
