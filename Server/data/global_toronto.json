As part of the trip, McGuinness chose to ride Humunga Kowabunga — a popular thrill-seeking attraction that sees brave riders plunge five storeys in darkness through a massive body slide at a 60-degree angle.⁠\n⁠\nA long canal of water is meant to slow the landing of riders as they reach the bottom of Humunga Kowabunga; instead, McGuinness said, the flume of standing water “painfully forced” her one-piece bathing suit into her body.⁠\n⁠\nWalt Disney World has not commented publicly on the legal filing.⁠\n⁠\nThough McGuinness said she rode the slide in the proper position with her ankles crossed underneath her body, she became airborne toward the end of the ride. The impact of landing on the slide allegedly pushed the swimsuit fabric between her legs and “violently forced” a rush of water inside her body.⁠\n⁠\n“She experienced immediate and severe pain internally and, as she stood up, blood began rushing from between her legs,” the lawsuit reads.⁠\n⁠\nMcGuinness was brought to hospital. There, doctors discovered she suffered “severe and permanent bodily injury including severe vaginal lacerations.” The injuries included “a full thickness laceration” that caused McGuinness’s “bowel to protrude through her abdominal wall.”⁠\n⁠\nSome of McGuinness’ injuries were serious enough to require surgery.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images","created_time":1696456998,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=960&t=1696456998&sig=5b3c4adecaf59336d828ca6e64303c30eef69d8aa1df6ef839f0a647f7310690","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696456998&sig=d98ac54ae63d1210d4bb43913f6ff7cb46a348eeb729b8fdfbcc4fa1ae5d3502","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10001607/disney-world-lawsuit-waterslide-woman-injured/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38296149&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18061199851413464","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/27228c3c01cd26-LIB38296149.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696456998&sig=d45f4a1ae470290fa4292979b761a06322214777ba7a4a325b9a802ac67c292d","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311164899,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696457113,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38266351,"caption":"Liberal MP Greg Fergus replaced Anthony Rota as Speaker of the House of Commons Tuesday, making history as the first Black Canadian to hold the role.⁠\n⁠\nFergus, who represents the National Capital Region Quebec riding of Hull—Aylmer, was one of seven candidates vying for the job after Rota resigned from it last week amid international controversy over his actions during a recent visit by Ukraine’s president.⁠\n⁠\n“Today, you are the first Black Canadian to become Speaker of this House,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after the election.⁠\n⁠\n“This should be inspiring for all Canadians.”⁠\n⁠\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called Fergus’s election an “incredible feat.”⁠\n⁠\nFergus’s election follows a day of pitches from the other MPs seeking the role: Liberal MP Sean Casey kicked off the speeches saying there needs to be a reset in the House when it comes to decorum, while Liberal MP Alexandra Mendes said more than anything, civility is needed.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press","created_time":1696368489,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=960&t=1696368489&sig=e515ca62f667dd4bf6e526034557aa3e6965320124be6cde584551433e444ce5","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696368489&sig=f36176d45a9b436ff6d3b1d31e6c9eaf375e747a6cba5248d75297be0bc23cd4","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10000914/canada-house-speaker-election/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38266351&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18023979991731500","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e61d22c6888595-LIB38266351.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696368489&sig=3bccc4d6b358a5580fbe84b9f2b20186aff1e3f4cb23ae55d8afec652ac9465e","network_type":"instagram","post_id":311014078,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696368528,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38259084,"caption":"Actor Tom Hanks has warned his fans not to fall victim to an advertisement using a fake photo of him generated by artificial intelligence (AI).⁠\n⁠\nOn Saturday, the 67-year-old film star said the advertisement was using his likeness without his permission to hawk a dental plan.⁠\n⁠\nHanks shared a screenshot of the ad to Instagram with the caption, “Beware!!

Approximately 326,942 vehicles in Canada are affected, as well as 1.6 million cars in the U.S.⁠\n⁠\nTransport Canada says the issue with these Hyundai models stems from the anti-lock brake system, which can leak brake fluid and cause a short circuit.⁠\n⁠\nHyundai Canada told Global News that an electrical short can increase the risk of the engine catching on fire while driving or even when its parked and turned off.⁠\n⁠\nSo far, there have been “no crashes, injuries, or fatalities attributable to this condition,” Hyundai Canada said.⁠\n⁠\nHowever, in the U.S., Hyundai has reported 21 vehicle fires and 22 “thermal incidents, including visible smoke, burning and melting” related to the recalled cars.⁠\n⁠\nHyundai Canada says owners can continue driving the recalled cars, but “recommends parking the vehicles outside and away from structures until the recall remedy is completed.”⁠\n⁠\nAs for Kia, the vehicles that have been recalled include certain 2010-2017 models of the Sportage, Optima, Forte, Sorento, Soul, Rio, Cadenza, Rondo, Borrego and K900. Approximately 276,225 cars in Canada have been recalled, as well as 1.7 million vehicles in the U.S.⁠\n⁠\nThe issue with the cars also creates a “fire risk,” like with the Hyundai models, but the culprit this time is the brake hydraulic electronic control unit, which can short circuit even while the vehicle is parked and turned off, Transport Canada said.⁠\n⁠\nKia owners are also cautioned to park their vehicles outdoors and away from other cars or buildings until the necessary repairs can be completed.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Getty","created_time":1696075491,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=960&t=1696075491&sig=1e4ac3c37421b9666549985f01e02698153a71ddc4c903ebe6d19e1d06608c71","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1696075491&sig=d0b474571380efb00cc5aa198495a28907d26b6113e892487e649e36d5cc4e84","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9991443/hyundai-kia-recall-canada-fire/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38197567&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18000022834976715","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/6873c119986da7-LIB38197567.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1696075491&sig=c3ab8987e39898514bfd0cdca484fd30eaab7c03f0461f8b3c700f32d6db35c2","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310636476,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1696096994,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38165191,"caption":"A hungry black bear interrupted a family picnic in the north of Mexico on Monday, devouring a whole bunch of enchiladas and tacos.

He moved to London as a child and went on to apprentice as a toolmaker before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.⁠\n⁠\nBefore donning a long, white beard to play Dumbledore for the first time in 2004’s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gambon already had an esteemed stage, TV and film career.⁠\n⁠\nGambon was tapped to take over the role of the Hogwarts’ headmaster in 2004 following the death of Richard Harris in October 2002. Harris played Dumbledore in the first two films in the Harry Potter franchise.⁠\n⁠\nThroughout his lifetime, Gambon was nominated for two Emmy Awards and won four BAFTA Awards, two Olivier Awards and a SAG Award for outstanding cast performance in The King’s Speech. ⁠\n⁠\nHe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Global News","created_time":1695922498,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=960&t=1695922498&sig=bd0a419dc39731ef8186dbc787b3f55e7c524ebb21a012fe061b99be5dd3be3c","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695922498&sig=db547961b97bf02f0e7b6d74e36c354cbcbbc21a121d554ef9a2b784f60ac63c","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9991426/michael-gambon-dumbledore-harry-potter-dies-82/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38158233&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17981370149440305","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/c07826b6c4eab5-LIB38158233.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695922498&sig=63a420a02c27ca004b7ee0f58e38b075a8465fd4abdd98ac2fea9beffa6e087b","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310440889,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695922514,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38153194,"caption":"President Joe Biden’s dog, Commander, can’t seem to keep his mouth to himself.⁠\n⁠\nFor the 11th time, the adolescent German Shepherd has bit someone — this time a U.S. Secret Service agent.⁠\n⁠\nIn July, White House officials said the first family was working with new training and leash protocols to help the reactive animal.⁠\n⁠\nResponding to this most recent bite, Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for the first lady, Jill Biden, told The Guardian: “The White House can be a stressful environment for family pets, and the first family continues to work on ways to help Commander handle the often unpredictable nature of the White House grounds.”⁠\n⁠\nShe said the Bidens are “incredibly grateful to the Secret Service and executive residence staff for all they do to keep them, their family, and the country safe.”⁠\n⁠\nEarlier in Biden’s tenure, another of his dogs, Major, was involved in biting incidents at the White House and was moved out to live with family friends in Delaware.

He had just celebrated his 90th birthday less than a week ago on Sept. 19.⁠\n⁠\nMcCallum was the last original cast member on CBS’s NCIS, in which he played a bookish medical examiner for the Naval Criminal Investigation Service. The fan-favourite character of Ducky was introduced during the show’s launch in 2003 and appeared right through to the 20th season finale in May 2023.⁠\n⁠\nIn recent years, the actor had taken on a lighter shooting schedule for NCIS so he could spend time with his wife of 56 years, Katherine Carpenter, his children, grandchildren and cat, Nickie.⁠\n⁠\nScottish-born McCallum became a household name in the mid-’60s playing agent Illya Kuryakin in The Man from U.N.C.L.E, a TV series that rode the wave of spy thrillers that came out after the success of the James Bond films.⁠\n⁠\nMcCallum’s enigmatic, intellectual character on the show was particularly popular with teenage girls at the time — no doubt helped by the actor’s good looks and Beatlesque haircut. He and his co-star Robert Vaughn, who played main character Napoleon Solo, were often mobbed by young fans during personal appearances.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: CP Images","created_time":1695766042,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/44a7463b44c763-LIB38109109.jpg?width=960&t=1695766042&sig=5a157ed87c77e8a383947122c296e7f581502ff9bec6317218b5eee4f25de6db","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/44a7463b44c763-LIB38109109.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/44a7463b44c763-LIB38109109.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695766042&sig=7784ff97773781ace8a2fe663f7f267db73d11ade7e50c9328a233c09f6fca6b","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9985680/david-mccallum-dead-ncis-ducky/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38109109&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17855926065037584","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/44a7463b44c763-LIB38109109.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695766042&sig=9b6a0592f71e51f9a49cbdac1c77b74d9cee1f32a5c510b796409cf862ddec4f","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310199258,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695766214,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38107449,"caption":"Gymnastics Ireland has condemned racism and apologized after one of its judges appeared to snub a young Black gymnast at a medal ceremony last year.⁠\n⁠\nVideo of the incident resurfaced this weekend and again went viral on social media, racking up millions of views.⁠\n⁠\nIn the clip from March 2022, a group of young girls stand single file in their shiny gym suits to receive participation medals inside Dublin’s National Indoor Arena. ⁠\n⁠\nAs a judge from the competition distributes the prizes, she skips the only Black gymnast in line.

The apology was shared publicly the following day.⁠\n⁠\nThe body promised “nothing like this will happen again.” It said an independent expert will review the organization’s policies and procedures this year.⁠\n⁠\nThe young gymnast’s mother told The Guardian that despite arranging mediation between the family and the judge who handed out the medals, a representative from Gymnastics Ireland did not attend the meeting. The family said the decision not to attend the mediation wrongfully painted the incident as a personal dispute between them and the judge.⁠\n⁠\nGymnastics Ireland told The Guardian the organization “went to great lengths over the extended period to encourage participation in the mediation by both parties.” The body said it only recently “became aware that the family had expected an official representative from GI to be present at the mediation.”⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.","created_time":1695761388,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=960&t=1695761388&sig=303cc2c05ba502e4a832a22f6ec5c5bbd89d26c91e8c044f409759561ea8c947","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695761388&sig=a8ee3ad4ba67889033fc486b40b5af05bc44c52540915be897f52c8638f52aef","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9983110/gymnastics-ireland-apology-black-gymnast-denied-medal/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38107449&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17904346466779511","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7682d086f57a49-LIB38107449.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695761388&sig=a5bf3c0cb7745aa6d8ea3393976db4c3e07ce151caf4732a55ea16503f767e54","network_type":"instagram","post_id":310190370,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695761416,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38081163,"caption":"House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota apologized again Monday for last week inviting and paying tribute to a Ukrainian Second World War veteran who fought for Nazi Germany.⁠\n⁠\nThe tribute happened on Friday when Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president who is also Jewish, was in Ottawa for his first official visit since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.⁠\n⁠\nRota, who said he regretted his decision and was “deeply sorry” for any hurt he caused, is facing calls from the NDP and the Bloc Québécois to resign as Speaker.⁠\n⁠\n“My intention was to show that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not a new one; that Ukrainians have unfortunately been subject to foreign aggression for far too long and that this must end,” he said.⁠\n⁠\n“I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision to recognize this individual.

She accused Scientology of using “mob-style operations and attacks” to harass her since she defected from the faith in 2013.⁠\n⁠\nRemini has since amended her lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court and claimed the harassment against her has “escalated to a much greater degree than ever before,” according to Deadline, which shared the revised complaint.⁠\n⁠\nScientology has not yet responded publicly to Remini’s new allegations. The organization previously called the lawsuit “pure lunacy” and accused Remini of “spreading falsehoods and hate speech.”⁠\n⁠\n“Remini’s complaints are like an anti-Semite complaining about the Jewish Anti-Defamation League for exposing the anti-Semite’s bigotry and propaganda,” the Church wrote. “The Church is not intimidated by Remini’s latest act of blatant harassment and attempt to prevent truthful free speech. If Remini does not believe in free speech, then she should consider emigrating to Russia.”⁠\n⁠\n“Since the filing of my lawsuit, these attacks have escalated dramatically and have now more than ever focused not only on me, but my family members, my friends and professional colleagues,” Remini wrote in her amendment, according to NBC News. “To date, my requests have been dismissed as these abuses continue on a daily basis.”⁠\n⁠\nRemini claimed that since filing the lawsuit against Scientology, “potential fraud” has been flagged on several of her credit cards. The instance of fraud is allegedly “significantly higher” than any fraud previously witnessed by Remini’s financial manager. ⁠\n⁠\nA tutor hired by Remini — who said they’ve separately been targeted by Scientology promotions — was also hacked, resulting in an apparent US$15,000 (over C$21,100) loss to their business.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Michael Tran/Getty Images","created_time":1695560806,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=960&t=1695560806&sig=c5c01480085fac728270762506ebef006eb9d490f4f1b0841819081e375a3291","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695560806&sig=ba5f02155908f7c128757a8133683c4243210c3f3d6250cbfd821b213c457845","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9978691/leah-remini-scientology-harassment-lawsuit-mother-friends/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38049514&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17955837695530359","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/5e2146a30f9920-LIB38049514.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695560806&sig=231467f7507915f801d04983a3bf1c5e25e6b36e65efd9b6f3ea9b1d1007dc95","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309893984,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695567911,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38041974,"caption":"The first-ever painting completed on television by Bob Ross — the beloved, perm-sporting artist who celebrated his “happy accidents” — is on sale for US$9.8 million (over C$13.2 million).⁠\n⁠\nRoss painted A Walk in the Woods in 1983 during the first episode of his TV show The Joy of Painting, which captured the hearts (and paintbrushes) of audiences around the globe.

After purchasing the piece for an undisclosed amount, the woman hung A Walk in the Woods in her home for 39 years, The Associated Press reported.⁠\n⁠\nThough Ross normally painted three versions of his works — a reference image before filming the TV show, one during filming and another for his step-by-step books — the version for sale was proven to be the one painted by Ross on camera. ⁠\n⁠\nThe Washington Post reported it took art analysts at Bob Ross Inc., the company that owns the rights to his TV show, two days to determine Ross’ brush strokes and knife work was identical to the version of A Walk in the Woods now owned by Modern Artifact.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage 1: Acey Harper/Getty Images⁠\nImage 2: AP Photo/Mark Vancleave","created_time":1695473705,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=960&t=1695473705&sig=dea7312703ec61e7577de0ca640e2b39e074acd443a05d4e3db00960690eeeda","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695473705&sig=edd722a78aaa852e3746d16f049e25821ed2fcb055f1ed5d58d960186e737667","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9976319/bob-ross-painting-sale/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38041974&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18235705465236698","media_type":"carousel","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/e6994f0470b4d6-LIB38041974.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695473705&sig=a28946237730d8be9719f345478c27d4a88096d4dffdb75825bf16a8e9c6db38","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309855938,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695484873,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38032818,"caption":"On National Voter Registration Day in the U.S., Taylor Swift urged her millions of fans to Speak Now and let their democratic voices be heard. ⁠\n⁠\nHer callout led to “record-breaking traffic” to Vote.org,  a non-profit voting registration website, which said it saw the most sign-ups in years thanks to the pop star’s help.⁠\n⁠\nSwift shared a message on her Instagram story Tuesday morning asking her fans if they had registered to vote yet for the upcoming 2024 U.S. elections.⁠\n⁠\n“I’ve been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my US shows recently. I’ve heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you’re ready to use them in our elections this year!”⁠\n⁠\nWithin the hour that Swift made her post, traffic on the Vote.org website shot up 1226 per cent, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey.⁠\n⁠\n“Our site was averaging 13,000 users every 30 minutes — a number that Taylor Swift would be proud of,” Hailey wrote in a press release shared with Global News.⁠\n⁠\nThirteen, as Swifties would know, is the pop star’s lucky number.⁠\n⁠\nIn total, 35,252 people registered to vote through the site on Tuesday, an improvement of 22.5 per cent compared with last year’s campaign. Vote.org states that this year’s National Voter Registration Day was the most successful since 2020, a year that saw now-President Joe Biden face off against then-incumbent Donald Trump in a highly contentious election.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management","created_time":1695408164,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/0c75c26d5f9f41-LIB38032818.jpg?width=960&t=1695408164&sig=778a1541336af38420fa671088225f82846febf20b6d7f4555c24d3753442648","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/0c75c26d5f9f41-LIB38032818.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/0c75c26d5f9f41-LIB38032818.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695408164&sig=cadacfa48023cb565e0bc2cee4425c2bbd83313239b448d8f1c00f7e9bf11fb5","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9978763/taylor-swift-post-voter-registration/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38032818&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17998992583980519","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/0c75c26d5f9f41-LIB38032818.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695408164&sig=d18c2a072b23454689df979e995398c40f050b0d99bf50109e3c69f5dd3c2e0c","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309807675,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695408255,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38010220,"caption":"The divorce between Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner continues to get messier and more complicated by the day, and now Turner is suing her soon-to-be ex-husband and requesting that their two children be returned to England to live with her.⁠\n⁠\nAccording to legal documents, obtained by Entertainment Tonight, Turner has petitioned for the “immediate return” of their one- and three-year-old daughters. The documents state the couple made England their permanent home earlier this year.⁠\n⁠\nThe documents also reveal that the custody arrangement that’s been in the works as part of the divorce proceedings has become a point of contention.⁠\n⁠\n“On or about September 17, 2023, the parties met to discuss their separation,” the docs state, according to ET. “(Turner) reiterated the parties’ agreed plan for the children to return home to England that week. (Jonas) has possession of the children’s passports. He refuses to return the passports to (Turner) and refuses to send the children home to England with (Turner).”⁠\n⁠\nThe documents also allege that Turner found out about the divorce not from Jonas or his legal team – but from the media.⁠\n⁠\nJonas hit back at those claims Thursday just hours after news broke of Turner’s lawsuit.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Fs/AdMedia via ZUMA Press Wire","created_time":1695334324,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/b5385a007ce150-LIB38010220.jpg?width=960&t=1695334324&sig=00ccd498e468cf13ebb73fbf4227bec8b9ef553669c76be950fb758cc2c33a18","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/b5385a007ce150-LIB38010220.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/b5385a007ce150-LIB38010220.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695334324&sig=64f21447ecd440606ea96312b93a517e4bde32e9fd373203dc67d2e14b2cb41c","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9977220/sophie-turner-sue-joe-jonas-divorce-kids-uk/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-38010220&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18073143160408260","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/b5385a007ce150-LIB38010220.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695334324&sig=1f980f658478f9c2054bcbac5693d96da9a1a6c635668738237b436ce6d697aa","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309707538,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695336611,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37999856,"caption":"The family of a teenage girl says that they were shocked when their daughter allegedly discovered an iPhone taped to the back of an airplane toilet seat, and they believe a member of the crew put it there in hopes of capturing footage of the 14-year-old using the washroom.⁠\n⁠\nThe family was travelling on American Airlines from Charlotte, N.C., to Boston on Sept. 2 when the alleged incident occurred.⁠\n⁠\nA photo of the phone, which was mostly covered by red and white tape, save for the flash and camera functions on the back of the device, had “Inoperative Catering Equipment” and “Remove From Service” printed on it with a note written in marker that said “Seat Broken.”⁠\n⁠\nThe picture was provided to the media by law firm Lewis & Llewellyn, LLP, which is representing the family.⁠\n⁠\nFamily members told the Post that their daughter had been waiting in line to use the coach washroom, when a male flight attendant approached the girl and offered to bring her to first class, saying there was no line up for the washroom there.⁠\n⁠\nThe family alleges that the crew member brought her to the front of the plane, but slipped in front of the girl, telling her he needed to quickly wash his hands before she used the facilities.⁠\n⁠\nAs he exited the washroom, he told the girl that the toilet seat was broken but not to worry about it, the family said in a written statement.⁠\n⁠\nIt wasn’t until after she flushed that she noticed the phone and took a photo of it, the family said.⁠\n⁠\nThe flight attendant then entered the washroom after she left, the family claims.⁠\n⁠\nClick the link in the @GlobalNews bio to read more.⁠\n⁠\nImage: Supplied⁠\n","created_time":1695310795,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/156027b738c822-LIB37999856.jpg?width=960&t=1695310795&sig=8e2e6a67863e9b9f5974a5184764c07d624455cef9f03c791c81f326fb7ebf2a","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/156027b738c822-LIB37999856.jpg","instagram_profile_id":3553390,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/156027b738c822-LIB37999856.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695310795&sig=9fde60ee9d950dd45c3edf488386116d7dca8f49e9d5e28097a60143255a6bb2","link_url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/9971139/teen-girl-iphone-plane-toilet-seat-american-airlines/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-globalnews&utm_content=later-37999856&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17923904108688815","media_type":"carousel","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/156027b738c822-LIB37999856.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695310795&sig=1a358ac12c12bdfaeef85ed472d00fcf84fa5809df30bf484d0fea6a9640a949","network_type":"instagram","post_id":309660510,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695333437,"social_profile_id":3553390,"linkinbio_post_links":[]}],"linkinbio_page_id":37292}
