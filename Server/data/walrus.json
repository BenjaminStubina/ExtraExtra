No power for weeks. Landmarks crumbling into the ocean. PEI survived its worst, most expensive storm with Fiona one year ago.\n\nAs dramatic footage of devastated coastal communities dominated national news in the days after the hurricane hit, debates began to rage about who should be accountable for securing Islanders and their properties from the impact of extreme weather.\n\nThe government had been announcing for days that a so-called storm of the century was likely to strike the Island. Why wasn‚Äôt the province more prepared?\n\nAhead of the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Fiona, Trevor Corkum spoke to Islanders about the disaster and the lessons they‚Äôve learned since.\n\nüîó Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Trevor Corkum\nüé® Kat Frick Miller (@katfrickmiller)","created_time":1695324208,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7000f7baebdcdb-LIB38006489.jpg?width=960&t=1695324208&sig=1301b95d8c44a8d17dc778cd84439e068b6353df3f7ea94aae228a38db23b8e2","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/7000f7baebdcdb-LIB38006489.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7000f7baebdcdb-LIB38006489.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695324208&sig=e50a1e86a619dab2b6b3acafff77d810bda6f10acbe7789ed67738cf04f4d4ce","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/prince-edward-island-storm/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-38006489&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18000378098095200","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/7000f7baebdcdb-LIB38006489.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695324208&sig=c3b87cac325e3bef34a5ecdc5c1de470ccee3d3bf710ce25df6b91de7c461052","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695220680,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37951480,"caption":"As a society facing an increasing burden of cancer, costing an estimated $26 billion in 2021, how do we allocate resources? \n\nShould we continue spending $150,000, or more, a year to treat a patient with a drug that provides marginal benefits?\n\nChristopher Booth, a medical oncologist and professor at Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario, acknowledges that, in the past decade, we‚Äôve had some transformative medications. \n\nHowever, he says, these are exceptions floating in a sea of mediocre drugs that extend life for three months on average, often just weeks. \n\nThere would be greater public health benefit if we instead put more into end-of-life care.\n\nHe says it‚Äôs easy to give a drug but almost impossible to find resources to let patients stay in their homes with good nursing, companionship, and good food.\n\n‚ÄúWe completely fail patients near the end of life where we provide one thing but not the other,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHow can we be okay with that?‚Äù\n\nüîó Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Ren√©e Pellerin\nüé® Jeannie Phan (@jeanniephan)","created_time":1695152169,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/2005676c5e183f-LIB37951480.jpg?width=960&t=1695152169&sig=356b1257c3572eef00263672e9aa12622448cd26964fdfe36ae2446b75e7223a","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/2005676c5e183f-LIB37951480.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/2005676c5e183f-LIB37951480.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695152169&sig=df746d2cbc8af87622675bf0276338dadfea4ef6353c215533c2e001ff43828b","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/are-we-losing-the-war-on-cancer/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37951480&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17971005173407367","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/2005676c5e183f-LIB37951480.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695152169&sig=6995d59c04eb40b465f69cf682e397229c9e39e72f91badb899ec4a7b5c4ce02","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695134266,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37878896,"caption":"It‚Äôs 2009. A Queen‚Äôs University student named Zoe sits on a bunk bed in a New York City hostel. She stares at her phone, unsure of what to do. It‚Äôs the nineteen-year-old‚Äôs first time in New York and her first time on a trip alone with her friends. She‚Äôs there for her spring break, with Dani‚Äîwhom she‚Äôs known since high school‚Äîand Fiona, a new addition to the friend group. Zoe and Dani have envisioned this trip for years. They imagined they would sightsee, play at being adults, and reconnect after months apart at their respective universities.\n\nWhat they didn‚Äôt plan for were the complications a third person might introduce to their dynamic. From the day they arrive, a romance sparks between Fiona and Zoe. They‚Äôve mostly kept this from Dani, stealing away for moments alone and holding hands when her back is turned. But the night before Dani disappears, they hook up in their hostel with Dani in the room. Now Dani is gone, and she didn‚Äôt leave a note. As Zoe spirals, Fiona rolls her eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou have your phone,‚Äù Fiona says flatly. She recommends sending a text. \n\nZoe puts her head in her hands and groans. ‚ÄúBut if I turn on roaming, won‚Äôt that cost a million dollars?‚Äù\n\nJillian (@jilliantamaki) and Mariko Tamaki (@marikotamaki), who wrote Roaming together, say the graphic novel‚Äôs title is partially a joke. While the word usually evokes the idea of exploration, for anyone travelling abroad, roaming comes with charges. The tension between these two things‚Äîfreedom and consequences‚Äîis central to the story. As these three young women explore an unknown city with a new-found sense of agency, they‚Äôre forced to learn that there are still boundaries to what they should and shouldn‚Äôt do‚Äîand pushing those boundaries comes with repercussions.\n\nMariko explains that nineteen is a potent and transitional age. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre on the lip of adulthood here,‚Äù she says. The push and pull between childhood and adulthood is part of what makes the dynamics in Roaming so complicated and messy.\n\nüîó Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Gabrielle Drolet (@gabrielle.drolet)\nüì∑ The Walrus / Unsplash","created_time":1694808318,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=960&t=1694808318&sig=c6db031925163ac65d1eb89e06c7f188e0864da52edf2fcad720bb6435338221","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1694808318&sig=07634868eab1baec8d3d304cdd4b79a86abf7e70f519102ab23b7fe32ceeb2e9","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/mariko-and-jillian-tamaki-roaming/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37878896&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17949017135577116","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1694808318&sig=e16eceadc4d42371810ee658bd9aefd899292f2460f41284c63acfbd9e254541","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1694807930,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37878903,"caption":"\"She holds a favourite serum up to the camera and squeezes a pea-sized drop onto the back of her terribly smooth hand.
