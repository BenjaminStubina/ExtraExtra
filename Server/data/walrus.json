Outside, the scene was utter devastation: a climatic apocalypse, with the sky turning unearthly colours. Sometimes even the Grim Reaper would make a cameo.\n\nThen Brothers would wake up, aware that he had spent another night in a climate-disaster dream. \n\n“It was regular enough that it was a part of my life,” he says.\n\nThe nightmares used to haunt Brothers more often when he was a PhD student in Berlin studying the interactions between climate change and lakes. \n\nThey had become less frequent—receding into memory, though still vivid—by the time he was announced, in November 2021, as the Royal Ontario Museum’s first curator of climate change.\n\nIt’s a highly visible platform: located in Toronto, the ROM is one of the most visited museums in Canada. \n\nBrothers is the face of the museum’s efforts to insert climate change into more of its collection and public events.\n\nYet, those expecting the museum to become an impassioned voice for greater climate action may initially be caught off guard.\n\nMuch of Brothers’s focus is on the positive and not just the calamitous—on initiatives that are working—even if that’s not the tone some museum goers might expect.\n\nWhere’s the rallying cry, they may ask. It shows the challenge the ROM and other museums face in finding the words to explain the science to a broad audience and to push for action while not disappointing those wanting to hear a more vociferous outcry.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Guy Dixon\n\n📷 The Walrus / Saty + Pratha / Royal Ontario Museum","created_time":1695746383,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f6ea1b5b5fd0ab-LIB38100723.jpg?width=960&t=1695746383&sig=e6a39e6a74948bff6ac84250ca56265cdd099b9b11c5cedcf2e5591982607069","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/f6ea1b5b5fd0ab-LIB38100723.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f6ea1b5b5fd0ab-LIB38100723.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1695746383&sig=4fca1b505ea74abe38b4b65c649102c85c9c5d0fefd8335bc34ee6131f8229e7","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/the-curator-of-climate-change/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-38100723&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17921687978703155","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f6ea1b5b5fd0ab-LIB38100723.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1695746383&sig=78e3de3a2835778ead7b043990ac4c412b048fff6ef873254aa2287a44f1a9e0","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1695746339,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":38080861,"caption":"There’s much excitement around AI in business but a lot of open questions too.

But 2023’s colour of the year has finally given us something a little bit different: Raspberry Blush. A vivacious shade of reddish orange not far from that of nearly ripe fruit. At long last, a colour with a little bit of oomph.\n\nWhy, all of a sudden, do we have such vibrant colours popping onto our palettes—especially at a time defined by the impending doom of the climate crisis, the war in Ukraine, and the crumbling economy?\n\nWhat we’re experiencing now is likely a ripple effect of the pandemic, says Montaha Hidefi, a Guelph-based “colour archeologist” and colour-trend forecaster.\n\nTwo years of being cooped up, stuck staring at the same four walls, made us want to trade in our neutrals for explosions of colours reminiscent of adventure and excitement. Their re-emergence is a possible light at the end of what has been a difficult decade.\n\nBut don’t expect to wake up in a Wes Anderson–style world of colour next week. It can take months or seasons to see these trends reflected in our interiors, since they often start in fashion—the most rapid of the trend cycles—and trickle outward from there.\n\n“It seems like more people are ready to accept colour in their life, but it’s a step-by-step process,” says Hidefi. “Maybe it starts with a pillowcase. Then a sofa.

A Queen’s University student named Zoe sits on a bunk bed in a New York City hostel. She stares at her phone, unsure of what to do. It’s the nineteen-year-old’s first time in New York and her first time on a trip alone with her friends. She’s there for her spring break, with Dani—whom she’s known since high school—and Fiona, a new addition to the friend group. Zoe and Dani have envisioned this trip for years. They imagined they would sightsee, play at being adults, and reconnect after months apart at their respective universities.\n\nWhat they didn’t plan for were the complications a third person might introduce to their dynamic. From the day they arrive, a romance sparks between Fiona and Zoe. They’ve mostly kept this from Dani, stealing away for moments alone and holding hands when her back is turned. But the night before Dani disappears, they hook up in their hostel with Dani in the room. Now Dani is gone, and she didn’t leave a note. As Zoe spirals, Fiona rolls her eyes.\n\n“You have your phone,” Fiona says flatly. She recommends sending a text. \n\nZoe puts her head in her hands and groans. “But if I turn on roaming, won’t that cost a million dollars?”\n\nJillian (@jilliantamaki) and Mariko Tamaki (@marikotamaki), who wrote Roaming together, say the graphic novel’s title is partially a joke. While the word usually evokes the idea of exploration, for anyone travelling abroad, roaming comes with charges. The tension between these two things—freedom and consequences—is central to the story. As these three young women explore an unknown city with a new-found sense of agency, they’re forced to learn that there are still boundaries to what they should and shouldn’t do—and pushing those boundaries comes with repercussions.\n\nMariko explains that nineteen is a potent and transitional age. “I think we’re on the lip of adulthood here,” she says. The push and pull between childhood and adulthood is part of what makes the dynamics in Roaming so complicated and messy.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Gabrielle Drolet (@gabrielle.drolet)\n📷 The Walrus / Unsplash","created_time":1694808318,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=960&t=1694808318&sig=c6db031925163ac65d1eb89e06c7f188e0864da52edf2fcad720bb6435338221","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1694808318&sig=07634868eab1baec8d3d304cdd4b79a86abf7e70f519102ab23b7fe32ceeb2e9","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/mariko-and-jillian-tamaki-roaming/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37878896&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17949017135577116","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1694808318&sig=e16eceadc4d42371810ee658bd9aefd899292f2460f41284c63acfbd9e254541","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1694807930,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37878903,"caption":"\"She holds a favourite serum up to the camera and squeezes a pea-sized drop onto the back of her terribly smooth hand.

I thought it would all be fine—and, honestly, it was fine right up until the homework started.\n\nThe worksheets began trickling home during grade one, and by the next year, my son was getting thick weekly packets of them. \n\nThe board policy was that children in his grade were supposed to receive around twenty minutes’ worth of work per night, but in our house, the agony was never that brief.\n\nOne week in grade two, my son came home with seventeen pages of homework, printed front and back—thirty-four worksheets filled with math problems and language exercises. \n\nHe worked on them every night, but by Sunday, he was only about three quarters of the way through.\n\nHe cried as he struggled to finish the homework. I cried as I emailed his teacher to tell her he hadn’t been able to finish it. \n\nWe both felt like we’d failed.\n\nWe were told that the work wasn’t mandatory, but that put me in a difficult position. I felt like, as a parent, I should be supporting what his teachers wanted from him, not acting against it.\n\nBesides, I believed that homework was necessary to set my son up for success. \n\nBut it turns out that homework might not be as useful as we think, writes Anne Thériault.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Anne Thériault\n🎨 Doug Rodas (@doughism)","created_time":1694636530,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a4375b6b6e9358-LIB37824099.jpg?width=960&t=1694636530&sig=8fc5321cd6b8c230012e535a9f0bfd803ca8f7154ff185d3cc5317a7631d356e","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/a4375b6b6e9358-LIB37824099.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a4375b6b6e9358-LIB37824099.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1694636530&sig=0c1715e9e96276d877a03b816f52c65b8c5f9e2387d0168680840bae3b5c9ae7","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/is-homework-good-for-kids/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37824099&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17920262987700158","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a4375b6b6e9358-LIB37824099.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1694636530&sig=056f73c60ed13af9fe7d34907aac9ae5ce9a97e5335fb9bc8c0e18f1f0c9ef63","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1694636420,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37824103,"caption":"“I was nervous to speak with Naomi Klein (@naomiaklein).
