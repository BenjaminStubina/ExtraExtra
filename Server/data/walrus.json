A Queen’s University student named Zoe sits on a bunk bed in a New York City hostel. She stares at her phone, unsure of what to do. It’s the nineteen-year-old’s first time in New York and her first time on a trip alone with her friends. She’s there for her spring break, with Dani—whom she’s known since high school—and Fiona, a new addition to the friend group. Zoe and Dani have envisioned this trip for years. They imagined they would sightsee, play at being adults, and reconnect after months apart at their respective universities.\n\nWhat they didn’t plan for were the complications a third person might introduce to their dynamic. From the day they arrive, a romance sparks between Fiona and Zoe. They’ve mostly kept this from Dani, stealing away for moments alone and holding hands when her back is turned. But the night before Dani disappears, they hook up in their hostel with Dani in the room. Now Dani is gone, and she didn’t leave a note. As Zoe spirals, Fiona rolls her eyes.\n\n“You have your phone,” Fiona says flatly. She recommends sending a text. \n\nZoe puts her head in her hands and groans. “But if I turn on roaming, won’t that cost a million dollars?”\n\nJillian (@jilliantamaki) and Mariko Tamaki (@marikotamaki), who wrote Roaming together, say the graphic novel’s title is partially a joke. While the word usually evokes the idea of exploration, for anyone travelling abroad, roaming comes with charges. The tension between these two things—freedom and consequences—is central to the story. As these three young women explore an unknown city with a new-found sense of agency, they’re forced to learn that there are still boundaries to what they should and shouldn’t do—and pushing those boundaries comes with repercussions.\n\nMariko explains that nineteen is a potent and transitional age. “I think we’re on the lip of adulthood here,” she says. The push and pull between childhood and adulthood is part of what makes the dynamics in Roaming so complicated and messy.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Gabrielle Drolet (@gabrielle.drolet)\n📷 The Walrus / Unsplash","created_time":1694808318,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=960&t=1694808318&sig=c6db031925163ac65d1eb89e06c7f188e0864da52edf2fcad720bb6435338221","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1694808318&sig=07634868eab1baec8d3d304cdd4b79a86abf7e70f519102ab23b7fe32ceeb2e9","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/mariko-and-jillian-tamaki-roaming/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37878896&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17949017135577116","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/f71704bdcead20-LIB37878896.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1694808318&sig=e16eceadc4d42371810ee658bd9aefd899292f2460f41284c63acfbd9e254541","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1694807930,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37878903,"caption":"\"She holds a favourite serum up to the camera and squeezes a pea-sized drop onto the back of her terribly smooth hand.

I thought it would all be fine—and, honestly, it was fine right up until the homework started.\n\nThe worksheets began trickling home during grade one, and by the next year, my son was getting thick weekly packets of them. \n\nThe board policy was that children in his grade were supposed to receive around twenty minutes’ worth of work per night, but in our house, the agony was never that brief.\n\nOne week in grade two, my son came home with seventeen pages of homework, printed front and back—thirty-four worksheets filled with math problems and language exercises. \n\nHe worked on them every night, but by Sunday, he was only about three quarters of the way through.\n\nHe cried as he struggled to finish the homework. I cried as I emailed his teacher to tell her he hadn’t been able to finish it. \n\nWe both felt like we’d failed.\n\nWe were told that the work wasn’t mandatory, but that put me in a difficult position.

She didn’t know that, over the following weeks, the RCMP would be called in or that the Canadian Armed Forces would send in more than 2,500 soldiers.\n\nThe standoff between the Kanien’kehá:ka and the army, the RCMP, and the provincial police lasted seventy-eight days, and Obomsawin would stay until the end.\n\nShe and her crew filmed clashes with the military; the army stopping food from reaching the land defenders; some locals hanging and burning an effigy of a warrior; a mob of Châteauguay residents stoning cars belonging to Kanien’kehá:ka, containing mostly women and children, with rocks the size of fists, windows shattering, glass shards lodged in skin, an elderly man hit in the chest, shirtless men cheering.\n\nShe interviewed the Kanien’kehá:ka women on the front lines of the standoff with the federal and provincial governments. She documented the protests held in solidarity with the Kanehsata’kehró:non. And she filmed the army’s tanks pushing into Kanien’kehá:ka territory.\n\nBy early September, few journalists remained; the CBC had pulled its reporters from the scene, citing fears of further violence. \n\nSome believe Obomsawin’s continued presence with a camera likely tempered the army—that things would have been worse if she weren’t there filming.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Zoe Heaps Tennant \n📷 Shelby Lisk (@shelbyliskphoto)","created_time":1693948359,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/254bc82d0e0402-LIB37639237.jpg?width=960&t=1693948359&sig=09f40147029fa1b4d7f7c70a6356b61a48c9f20c5039d9921fac9e4e9b9e153a","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/254bc82d0e0402-LIB37639237.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/254bc82d0e0402-LIB37639237.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1693948359&sig=a2fb1f56c0e93e134d098aa1c28425ea2ad13c6e9e431e2f6b8c34b43e4ff1a3","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/at-ninety-one-alanis-obomsawin-is-not-ready-to-put-down-her-camera/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37639237&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17971712990574289","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/254bc82d0e0402-LIB37639237.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1693948359&sig=b790a6e97fb165517cf8bedcad0353ce27f2e598a11a0f0d7bf4806c256b4a69","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1693947897,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37564572,"caption":"Read about the greatest scam ever written, the war on cancer, the pursuit of perfect skin, and more in our September/October issue.

They court peace in pools and lakes, postponing gravity, going nowhere fast.\n\nSometimes you can glimpse some rocks or stretch of shore at the edge of a frame, but mostly they are alone, buoyant and unbothered. \n\nThese scenes are rendered almost romantically, with impasto snarls of blue and green and ochre, and when Smith talks about them, she uses words like “serene,” and “meditation,” and “memory.”\n\nShe doesn’t even think of her women as “swimmers,” she says. “To me, it’s more intangible than that, a limitlessness that’s closer to flying.” \n\nSmith says she wants her audience to feel weightless, to experience that same kind of lightness you get in your chest while floating and watching the sky drift by.\n\nHer tableaus feel dreamlike insofar as they appear fuzzy from up close but cohere as recognizable, even familiar, scenes with a couple feet of distance and a couple seconds to find the visual logic.\n\nIn this way, her paintings mimic what it feels like to recall a moment. She’s interested in memory when it arrives involuntarily, like Proust and his tea-soaked madeleine.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full profile.\n\n✍️ Connor Garel (@nopeconnor)\n\n🎨 Vicki Smith (@vickismithstudio), Well-Being, 2023.

I papered my profile with quotes by Sigmund Freud and Philip Roth and deadpanned that my favourite books were simply “the big ones.” \n\nI didn’t mind all the beige, the slowness of the search feature, the sense that, if I turned around too quickly, I might catch the platform taking a nap. \n\nThe site catered to my undergraduate hunger for pretension, my need to perform my taste—a flame it continues to fan very capably in its users.\n\nGradually, things started to go off the rails. \n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Tajja Isen (@tajja.isen)\n🎨 Celina Gallardo / iStock","created_time":1693337178,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/57c7bf71a09721-LIB37489226.jpg?width=960&t=1693337178&sig=be62f95f3a9a2ee03ef3067c6a0bf379bf3d7e720245cfd038b49088c3ebdcf9","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/57c7bf71a09721-LIB37489226.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/57c7bf71a09721-LIB37489226.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1693337178&sig=c4c8beac407bc652e35f8e8fc0398cdae64b30560b76cda9fa5859e977ce7d6e","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/goodreads-is-terrible/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37489226&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17913515552796301","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/57c7bf71a09721-LIB37489226.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1693337178&sig=d80b82527b1f52014d1568c15f66ac7a74f1b797b24f50464b6fa931bed675f4","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1693337072,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37459535,"caption":"Generative AI refers to the subset of artificial intelligence that can generate video, images, music, and text. \n\nIt’s the technology behind the breakout hit ChatGPT, a tool that answers questions using natural, human-like language and can simulate writing styles. \n\nThanks to its broad utility, generative AI promises to become foundational for new services and economies. \n\nThe technology has also sparked controversy and legal challenges. Artists and creators have been the most vocal, but the debate is also drawing in other industries concerned with how automation will reshape society.\n\nThat concern is not simply about how generative AI threatens to erode, and overtake, human creativity. It goes deeper: Are such models legal? \n\nThere isn’t an easy answer. Today’s AI systems are variations of machine learning that require a lot of data to train on (as well as a lot of energy-intensive processing). \n\nThe more data they get, the more accurate the systems become. Where do AI teams find all that data? The internet. \n\nChatGPT’s legal status depends on how it treats this public data. OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company that created the advanced chatbot, promises not to “actively seek out personal information to train our models, and we do not use public information on the internet to build profiles about people, advertise to or target them, or to sell user data.” \n\nThe problem is AI systems tend not to distinguish between what’s private and what isn’t. They gobble up whatever they find. But to process personal information, AI companies need explicit consent.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Fenwick McKelvey\n🎨 Celina Gallardo / iStock","created_time":1693249174,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a056cd9a477fcc-LIB37459535.jpg?width=960&t=1693249174&sig=e3a0e5f79102a58c13b5f09aa147c1df2bca6a5899a600d94029ec70c3f0a681","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/a056cd9a477fcc-LIB37459535.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a056cd9a477fcc-LIB37459535.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1693249174&sig=b3fa444eec96f33c9b06fa45a412a0bafdd847aa93ce5f39c80f661a3e17b696","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/wait-is-chatgpt-even-legal/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37459535&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"17971034177539116","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/a056cd9a477fcc-LIB37459535.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1693249174&sig=16b1a0dd474f170c2c668cf75cee4defca86c5f67d37c164953adeabd2149c7b","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1693249123,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]},{"id":37459335,"caption":"“In the days leading up to the Yellowknife wildfire evacuation order, I found myself in a familiar place: struggling to discern how much danger we were all in.\n\nEven as a major blaze loomed twenty kilometres from the city’s outskirts, near our only road out, and two other fires closed in from the north and east, I was never sure if I was taking the threat seriously enough or if I was overreacting.\n\nWe’ve all been waging similar internal battles over the past three-plus years of public safety and social etiquette protocols introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Do I drop my kid off at daycare with that runny nose? Should I go to that party if I still have this sore throat? \n\nThis constant and cumulative risk assessment—perceived or real, to myself or to others—seems to have damaged my ability to evaluate a threat and respond appropriately. My calculator is fried from overuse.\n\nWildfires are a part of Northern life. In 1998, a nearby fire blanketed the territorial capital in thick smoke. That summer’s edition of Folk on the Rocks, the local music festival, was known as Smoke on the Rocks. As a badge of pride, Yellowknifers swap stories about where they were one late-July day in 2014 when the skies went pitch black and rained ash around 5 p.m.\n\nThis fire season has felt different.

The prolonged and extremely hot and dry weather.”\n\nIn this essay, Herb Mathisen reflects on the wildfires roaring in Yellowknife and the tough decision to leave his hometown.\n\n🔗 Click the link in our bio to read the full story.\n\n✍️ Herb Mathisen\n📷 Maggie Davies","created_time":1693248699,"high_res_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8eb11e03867928-LIB37459335.jpg?width=960&t=1693248699&sig=600125b67158a0918bbab5131a97bc3519cf873154e129f08cf6ef0abac40085","image_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/linkinbio/8eb11e03867928-LIB37459335.jpg","instagram_profile_id":6452093,"large_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8eb11e03867928-LIB37459335.jpg?width=320&height=320&t=1693248699&sig=fa2847a4d26445cac7e799ca404d1f26181456db69b08cbbbed7d7ebcffa8e6e","link_url":"https://thewalrus.ca/yellowknife-fires/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thewalrus&utm_content=later-37459335&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio","media_id":"18019922425728593","media_type":"image","med_thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn.later.com/t/linkinbio/8eb11e03867928-LIB37459335.jpg?width=240&height=240&t=1693248699&sig=7454dbd97dad9f3861e1eded420497bc3b99b0feb053f8f7d4a750a96cdcd61f","network_type":"instagram","post_id":null,"post_type":"feed","posted_time":1693248656,"social_profile_id":6452093,"linkinbio_post_links":[]}],"linkinbio_page_id":318464}
