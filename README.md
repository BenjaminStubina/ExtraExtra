# ExtraExtra
ExtraExtra is a simple web app designed as a central hub for Canadian news sources, including prominent outlets like Global, CBC, CTV, and the Globe and Mail. Its inception was prompted by the introduction of the "Online News Act" by the Canadian federal government in July of 2023, which compelled major tech companies like META and Google to compensate news outlets for the use of their content. In response, META decided to prohibit Canadian news publishers from sharing their content on popular social media platforms like Instagram, Threads, and Facebook.

This unprecedented ban by META led to a critical gap in Canadians' access to news, leaving many unaware of current events. ExtraExtra steps in as a quick solution, offering a user-friendly platform where individuals can swiftly access up-to-date Canadian news from reputable sources with direct links to the articles. With ExtraExtra, users can stay informed, bridging the gap left by the ban and ensuring that essential news remains easily accessible to all Canadians.
