# Extra! Extra! News returns to social media

_Extra! Extra!_ is a central hub for Canadians to access news. It was born from necessity after major social networks banned news from their platforms in response to the _Online News Act_. This bill requires the largest social platforms to compensate media outlets for using their content.

This unprecedented ban left a critical gap in Canadians' access to news, leaving many unaware of current events. _Extra! Extra!_ is our stopgap solution, a feed-style aggregator and social media account where individuals can find up-to-date posts from reputable sources and direct links to full stories. With _Extra! Extra!_, users can stay informed, ensuring that essential information remains easily accessible to all Canadians.
